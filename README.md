**Welcome** to my **profile**!

## Summary
I am focused on creating maintainable and scalable solutions that meet the needs of OOP and SOLID principles & business goals. 

I specialize in writing clean code architecture using DI, applying design patterns, and implementing various gameplay mechanics.
 
I love to solve complicated problems in a simple and beautiful way and by giving a problem to me you can be sure I found a creative solution for it!
